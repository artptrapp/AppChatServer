# SimpleNodeTypescriptBoilerplate
This is a very simple Node.JS TS Boilerplate with Live Reload. It also includes log4js and a simple JWT middleware.

To run the project, do the following:

- Go to the root of the project
- `npm install`

That's it, folks.

To run it with livereload, just do `npm run dev` in your command line. To build and run once, just execute `npm start` in your command line.
